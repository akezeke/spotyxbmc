spotyxbmc - Spotify in XBMC

Until the possibility to create and use binary add-ons in XBMC the only way to use spotyxbmc is to apply a patch and modify the xbmc source.

Spotify is not allowing clients based on despotify to connect to their servers anymore. 
And there is a license conflict between xbmc and spotifylib; therefore the precompiled versions are useless for now. 
To use spotyxbmc you have to compile it yourself.


BUILD SPOTYXBMC YOURSELF LINUX 32/64
--------------------------------
1. Download libSpotify
Witch version to choose?
0.0.3: It is working; missing some features such as high bitrate and the artist browse workaround is needed
0.0.4: Might be working on your system, not on mine
0.0.6: I have yet to try it, might give some performance benefits, allows for additional features in future releases of spotyxbmc

Choose version and download one of the following:
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.3-linux6-i686.tar.gz
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.4-linux6-i686.tar.gz
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.6-linux6-i686.tar.gz
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.3-linux6-x86_64.tar.gz
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.4-linux6-x86_64.tar.gz
$ wget http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-0.0.6-linux6-x86_64.tar.gz

2. Untar:
$ tar xzf libspotify-*.tar.gz

3. Workaround for byte conflict
$ cd libspotify-0.0.... (your version)
$ sed 's/byte/byte2000/g' ./include/spotify/api.h > ./include/spotify/api.h

4. Install libspotify
$ sudo make install

5. Obtain xbmc source
$ cd ..
$ svn co http://xbmc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xbmc/trunk

6. Patch xbmc with spotyxbmc patch
$ cd trunk
$ git clone git://github.com/akezeke/spotyxbmc.git
$ cp -r ./spotyxbmc/* ./
$ patch -p0 -i ./spotyxbmc.diff

7. Spotify API key
Get your own spotify API key from http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/application-key/
Add it to the beginning of ./xbmc/xbmc/spotinterface.cpp.

$ gedit ./xbmc/spotinterface.cpp 

9. Install all XBMC dependencies listed in the corresponding readme file.

10. Configure xbmc
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --disable-pulse

11. Manually add "-lspotify" to LIBS in Makefile with your favorite text editor.
$ gedit ./Makefile

12. Compile
$ make

13. Install
$ sudo make install

14. OPTIONAL, create a advancedsettings file and save your spotify credentials

No need for a advancedsettings, spotify is now enabled by default but if you donâ€™t want to enter your
spotify username and password on every XBMC session this is the only way to do it.

Ubuntu: Create advancedsettings.xml in ~/.xbmc/userdata/

$ gedit ~/.xbmc/userdata/advancedsettings.xml

Possible settings for the advancedsettings.xml are in full:

<advancedsettings>
	<spotify>
		<enable>true</enable>
		<username>USERNAME</username>
		<password>SECRETPASSWORD</password>
		<cachefolder>/home/YOURUSER/cache/spotify/</cachefolder>
                <highbitrate>true</highbitrate>
		<maxsearchartists>30</maxsearchartists>
		<maxsearchalbums>30</maxsearchalbums>
		<maxsearchtracks>150</maxsearchtracks>
	</spotify>
</advancedsettings>

15. Start xbmc
$ xbmc

16. Scan music to your music library

17. Enable library

18. Enjoy spotify music inside xbmc

Done!

--------------------------------

BUILD SPOTYXBMC YOURSELF WINDOWS
--------------------------------

The same procedure as on a linux system,
get XBMC source
get libspotify
get spotyxbmc source and apply patch
get libspotify API key

On windows the libspotify 0.0.4 is recommended, and to use the high bitrate feature you have to uncomment the two rows concerning high bitrate in spotinterface.cpp

    //if (g_advancedSettings.m_spotifyUseHighBitrate)
    //  sp_session_preferred_bitrate(m_session, SP_BITRATE_320k);
    
at row 730 and 731

Put libspotify.lib in project\BuildDependencies\lib
Create a folder named spotify in the xbmc folder, put api.h in there

Compile and install

Enable music library and add at least one song to it


KNOWN ISSUES
--------------------------------
- Problems when music library is empty
- Albums with multiple discs will only appear as one
