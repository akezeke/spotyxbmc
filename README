TINKER AROUND (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------
No need for a advancedsettings, spotify is now enabled by default!

Ubuntu: Create advancedsettings.xml in ~/.xbmc/userdata/
Windows: Create advancedsettings.xml in whereever yoy did choose to keep your userdata, it might be in
INSTALLDIR/userdata or USER/appdata/roaming/XBMC/userdata/

Possible settings for the advancedsettings.xml is in full:

<advancedsettings>
	<spotify>
		<enable>true</enable>
		<username>USERNAME</username>
		<password>SECRETPASSWORD</password>
		<cachefolder>/home/YOURUSER/cache/spotify/</cachefolder>
		<maxsearchartists>30</maxsearchartists>
		<maxsearchalbums>30</maxsearchalbums>
		<maxsearchtracks>150</maxsearchtracks>
	</spotify>
</advancedsettings>

Run XBMC the usual way, and hopefully everything works as expected.
NOTE that you have to activate library mode to be able to access the Spotify content.
