TINKER AROUND (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------
No need for a advancedsettings, spotify is now enabled by default but if you dont want to enter your
spotify username and password on every XBMC session this is the only way to do it.

Ubuntu: Create advancedsettings.xml in ~/.xbmc/userdata/
Windows: Create advancedsettings.xml in whereever yoy did choose to keep your userdata, it might be in
INSTALLDIR/userdata or USER/appdata/roaming/XBMC/userdata/

Possible settings for the advancedsettings.xml is in full:

<advancedsettings>
	<spotify>
		<enable>true</enable>
		<username>USERNAME</username>
		<password>SECRETPASSWORD</password>
		<cachefolder>/home/YOURUSER/cache/spotify/</cachefolder>
                <highbitrate>true</highbitrate>
		<maxsearchartists>30</maxsearchartists>
		<maxsearchalbums>30</maxsearchalbums>
		<maxsearchtracks>150</maxsearchtracks>
	</spotify>
</advancedsettings>

Run XBMC the usual way, and hopefully everything works as expected.
NOTE that you have to activate library mode to be able to access the Spotify content.
